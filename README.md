This is a program to drive an Arduino used in an interactive sculture.

The sculpture was used in a one woman show about a fictional "hippie" artist. The sculpture portrays a human male torso, covered in crushed orange prescription pill bottles. The outline of a throat and stomach are displayed on the front and outlined with EL wire. There is a push button on the top of the torso where the head would be. Pressing the button triggers this series of actions:

1. A pulse of white LEDs moves down the throat, into the stomach
2. The pulse/white LEDs turn off
3. Colored LEDs beneathe the pill bottles are triggered randomly for a short while
4. The piece is reset and all LEDs turn off
